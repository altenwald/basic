# BASIC

Yes, it's BASIC, but it's not an usual BASIC and even it's not Dartmouth
BASIC or True BASIC, it's the nasty one, it's based on Altair BASIC, that
BASIC that you should to use line numbers, that basic that has GOSUB and
a lot of GOTOs. It's the BASIC that Bill Gates and Paul Allen made for
creating their empire so, let's see if that's helping me with my empire
almost 50 years later.

Well, let's going to the point.

## What you can find here?

BASIC. You can parse and run code like this:

```BASIC
10 LET X = 10
20 PRINT X
30 X = X - 1
40 IF X > 0 THEN 10
```

Yes! Oh! You know this language and you think my code is nasty, well, it's
the idea, of course you can write it in a more elegant way:

```BASIC
10 FOR N = 10 TO 1 STEP -1
20 PRINT X
30 NEXT N
```

Better? Oh! You think you can do it even better, how dare you! Challenge
accepted, send me your code and I'll put it as a test in the `test/code`
directory for ensuring that is working as expected ;-)

## But why?!?

Ah! Is that important? I didn't know, I was bored and I wanted to start
again coding as I was 12, 1992, and I wanted to publish some challenges
online with easter eggs hidden, if you want to see one of them, again,
send me a message via Twitter (@MRonErlang) or email, or whatever else.

Enjoy!
